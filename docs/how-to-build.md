# How to Build

Building is straight forward.

The app is built on Tauri and uses npm as the package manager.<br>
**Step 1**: Make sure npm is installed. Follow official instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)<br>
**Step 2**: Open the repository in the terminal of your choice and run `npm install`
**Step 3**: Build the app, or run it in dev mode if you are doing development:<br>
**Build**

```
npm run tauri build
```

the output will show you the location of the built executable

**Dev**

```
npm run tauri dev
```

this will launch the application in dev mode
